# Silver Skies - Processor (SSP)
A processor project focused on speed, efficiency, cost, and performance.

> [!NOTICE]
> This is a modern CPU architecture, so you may expect a microcode engine to exist but there will never be one for this CPU. The reason is there is simply no good use or high enough benefits to use it. It reduces performance and was mainly to prevent hardwiring. But now CPUs are made in VHDL so this becomes unnecessary.
